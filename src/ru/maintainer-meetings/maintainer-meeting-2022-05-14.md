## Launcher server announcements | moony
- The launcher listens to an RSS feed if you opt-in **per server (or server group)**.
    - Works for any server that has such a feed setup.
    - **It can be transient (truncated)**
- For both automated and manual announcements.
    - **Can be categorized.**
- Can announce a new round starting, or mandatory server restarts.
- Separate restart notifications from other notifications?
    - **Needs high poll rate**
    - **Don't have a websocket per server**
    - **Run a news aggregator as part of the hub?**
        - What happens to servers off the hub?
    - Just keep it simple no websocket stuff for now just RSS all the way baby.
    - **Push notifications for restarts**
- **Hook up changelog to RSS updates**


## Automerging PRs when approved and CI passes | metalgearsloth
- Refined GitHub supports this but it doesn't work properly.
- Allegedly exists in GitHub by default but the button doesn't exist.
    - You can only enable it if you enable only being able to merge PRs when CI passes
        - Simply disable push to master --moony
- What if the servers DIDN'T autoupdate to broken builds??
    - check em before we wreck em
- **Use a bot (when you code it)**
    - **We can use the `workflow_run` workflow event to do this.**


## getFlatIcon() AKA handling capture of appearance data (photography, scoreboard, Remie bait) | PJB
- No BYOND-like server CPU rendering
- Send the visual information to the client (appearance components)
    - Move complex stuff like item rendering on mobs to be 100% visualizer data
- Just take a screenshot on the client? (photography) (Remie vindicated)
    - Easy to do
- How do we render multi-entity entities?
    - e.g. eris walls
    - **follow child entities and collect em all?**
- **Replace appearance visualizers with entity systems**
    - Already agreed on this in another meeting
    - Use component states to send the data?


## ABI vs API backwards compatibility on engine | PJB
- ABI: code keeps working dynamic linking against newer versions of the engine
- API: code keeps working if you recompile against newer versions of the engine
- **ABI stability**
- There might be GitHub analyzers to check this
    - May or may not be worth setting up
- **Aim for ABI, when you have to break it, increase major version**
```cs
// What you have:
void Foo(int x) => ...

// What you want:
void Foo(int x, int y = 0) => ...

// What you need to do to preserve ABI compat:
void Foo(int x) => Foo(x, 0); //method NOT removed
void Foo(int x, int y) => ...
```


## Private playtest/actual QA sessions | mirrorcult
- Making the maintainers, senior contributors and game admins play their game
- (Suspicion on Space Station)
- Whitelisted server on EUW2 or USW?
    - Maybe USW for the Australians.
    - **Put another server instance on USW ez clap**
- Schedule
    - **After the maintainer meeting (afterparty)**
- **The whitelist needs to be per server**


## Auto-ignore unknown components on the client and remove client IgnoredComponents | mirrorcult
Cases:
- server side component spelled correctly--ignored by client, no error on server
- server side component spelled incorrectly--ignored by client, server errors
- client side component spelled correctly--no error on client, server needs it in the ignore list
- client side component spelled incorrectly--ignored by client, server errors since it's no longer in the ignore list
- shared component spelled correctly--no error on client, no error on server
- shared component spelled incorrectly--ignored by client, server errors
- **Fund it**
