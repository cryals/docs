**Time:** 16 July 2022 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:**
- DrSmugleaf
- ElectroSR
- Silver
- Vera
- Ike709
- ShadowCommander
- PJB

## Replace EffectSystem with client-side entities | Metalgearsloth
- Effects don't have animations
- Can't have layered effects nor do fancy animations
- At the moment we mix the two
- They do the same thing and are legacy
- **Conclusion: Yes**


## Labelling EntityUids as "should have a component" | PJB
- Such as EntityUid\<ToolComponent\>
- Wouldn't really mean anything short of just being implicit cast to/from EntityUid when relevant, just a type hint kinda thing
- Vast majority would expect TransformComponent, would make more sense to explicitly say it doesn't require it
- ![](https://i.imgur.com/KqbK5vi.png)
    - ship it
- Generic struct that contains the entity uid and component, keeps it in a field
- **Conclusion: Ship it (When PJB Codes It)**


## Engine changelogs | Ike709
- Do we want them: Yes
- Who codes it: PJB
- When: RN
- With: MoMMI
- **Put the changelog in a markdown file**


## Replacing tags with tag components | Mirrorcult
- They often break with prototype inheritance
- Auto ignored comps are now a thing
- The engine needs to be optimized for this (store tag components as a bit flag instead of full components)
- Need proper ECS for this
- **Do it**


## Expanding the number of people allowed to merge PRs | Moony
- **Appoint more maintainers (easier now that master is protected)**
- Link docs automatically when a relevant file is changed.
    - Example: Link construction docs when a file relating to construction is changed.
- Fix the GitHub workflow to auto-remove "needs review" when the PR gets one review, if more reviews are needed put the tag back on.
    - Have it add waiting for review tag as well.
- **Re-read and re-write if necessary the review/PR guidelines.**
- **Show PR guidelines somewhere to the contributor when making a PR.**


## Making wide-attack based on click was a huge mistake | Remie
- [From previous notes](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/maintainer-meetups/secret/2022-06-25-meetup)
