## Standardize and document naming for (system) dependencies | Vera
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/1070066968419381320)
- [Original discussion](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/770682801607278632/1070064771761709076)
- **Remove the prefix and suffix.**
- What about UIControllers, where there is SharedHandsSystem, HandsGUI, HandsUIController.
- Keep it explicit with `_handsSystem`.
- **Make a maintainer vote for whether or not we enforce this (either an analyzer or as part of review.)**

## Debug vs DebugOpt vs Release vs ReleaseTools build configurations | PJB
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/1072637756955693067)
- **Yes**
- Release (closest to the launcher version) would be closer to what we have for the downloadable public build (FULL_RELEASE).
    - Can't be compiled easily because of filepath changes.
- Current release configuration (debug tools available) can become DebugOpt.
- Current debug configuration is the new Debug configuration.
- Tools (for mapping) is release with checks disabled and optimizations/tools enabled (tools is the launcher connect command).
- to summarize:
    - `Debug`: optimizations disabled, asserts enabled, tools enabled.
    - `DebugOpt`: optimizations enabled, asserts enabled, tools enabled.
    - `Tools`: optimizations enabled, asserts disabled, tools enabled.
    - `Release`: optimizations, asserts and tools disabled. As close to the launcher builds as you're gonna get while it stills runs from your repo.
- **Don't disable exception tolerance in debug.**

## Medical refactor | Jezithyr
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/1073932941878636624)
- This is basically old baymed (+ rimworld ~~+ EFT~~)
- Take notes on brainmed

- Make cloning lategame/not a solution to everything
    - And implement speedcloning where releasing someone too soon makes them miss body parts
