## Consolidating admin logs | metalgearsloth
- **Basically log categories**
- Make it backwards compatible
- When you code it
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/1197878030253707346)

## PRs for admin usage prototypes | metalgearsloth
Deny all PRs for admin usage prototypes:
- We have admin uploads
- Bloats the repo with meme content that's never used anywhere and requires ongoing maintenance
- Do we dump it on the admin repo
    - **No**
- **Allow admin-usage prototype PRs to the main repo**
- **Mark admin-only prototypes with an "Admin" suffix and admin-only category**
- **Have a test that checks that admin-only prototypes aren't mapped in**
- **Lower standards for reviewing, but don't allow copyrighted stuff to be on the main repo**
- **Anything that is supposed to be secret can stay in the admin repo**
- **Put them in a separate folder with a text file that clarifies to downstreams that they may be removed at any time**
- **If one of them breaks during a refactor it is fine to remove it**

## Code freezes | EmoGarbage
- We are extremely inconsistent about what a freeze means
- We dont actually enforce them in a consistent way
- We should outline what needs to be done for the freeze to end because leaving some vague criteria up in the air sucks
- [Current freezes](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14/issues/8524)
- Current conditions:
    - Maintainer approval will be required beforehand.
    - If the freeze is due to an ongoing rework then the rework PR will take precedent and your PR may require reworking prior to merge.
    - A design doc may be required depending upon the content. For example, a new item may not require a design doc, but a new antagonist will require one.
    - The PR will be scrutinised more than normal and will take longer to be reviewed.
    - As usual your PR is subject to not being merged into the repository, especially if maintainer approval is not sought beforehand.
- **Reword "freezes" to be clearer.**
    - Scrutinized?
    - **Restrictions**
    - Something for rework coming soon.
- **Have a separate thing for freezes that won't be accepted at the current time.**
- **We can review current freezes/restrictions after every maintainer meeting**
- **We need a list of things that can be ported as-is from SS13**
- **Define beginner-friendly PRs better vs first codebase PR**
    - We have a label, but it hasn't been managed well. The current ones are either outdated or harder than a first PR should be.

### Lobby songs freeze
- They take up too much space compared to the rest of the repository
- Do we stream them
- Do we have a CDN
- Do we have them on a separate repo
- **We stream them**
    - WYCI
    - Allow clients to fire HTTP requests in content (in a way that you don't make the client a botnet)
    - Not on the local network
- **Keep them frozen until that system is implemented**


## Current admin issues
- Ahelp relay does not tell you whether the player has disconnected or not. [23716]
- Ahelp window should tp you to the last character if the player is disconnected [20189]
- Specific admin actions can only be performed on logged in players(e.g. Erase) [23796]
- ASN bans (CE will make epic insanely detailed issue soon™️)
- Ghost roles need to have clearer descriptions so people stop getting bwoinked for being friendly antags [24333]
- A command to force a round type/map temporarily instead of putting it on perpetually as it works currently
