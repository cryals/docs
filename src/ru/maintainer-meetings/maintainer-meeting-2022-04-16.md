## We hit 250 players in one server. What's next? | moony
- What is our goal for optimizations
    - What can we do better
    - What should we do now that the game is very performant
- Is this when we finally code content
- We need to fix stuttering, pvs pop-in, rubberband issues and make network smoothing default to 2 | mirrorcult
- **Server side performance is fine, need to fix client side performance and bugs**


## Diagonal tiles | metalgearsloth
- The engine technology is there
- What do about anchoring and stuff on content
- Atmos will just treat them as space, still have diagonal walls be airtight
- **Needs to be fleshed out more**


## Make VV read/write by default | mirrorcult
- Everyone forgets to make properties read/write
- We still have to refactor VV for ECS
- **Make all VV properties writable if you have +HOST**
- **The default should be read**
- **Attribute to make all properties on a class VV**


## Review and PR guidelines | mirrorcult
- https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/maintainer-info/review-guidelines
- https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/getting-started/pr-guideline
- **We are missing file name conventions on the conventions page**
- **We need better automated tooling**
