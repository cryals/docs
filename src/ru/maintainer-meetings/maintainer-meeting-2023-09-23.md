## Change ToString & Parse for EntityUid or NetEntity | ElectroSR
- Commands that take either are now ambiguous, how do we differentiate between them
- **All commands should take NetEntity**
- What do we do for command output
    - **NetEntities should be the one getting presented to the user most of the time**
    - **e for EntityUid**
    - **n for NetEntity**
    - **c for client-side**

## Remove transparent / non-occluding containers for sprites | ElectroSR
- Right now they can not occlude lights and not occlude sprites.
- **Force containers to always occlude sprites.**
- **Wish we could put containers in content instead.**

## DERAILMENT: Containers as entities, how do we do it?
- **Entities with ContainerComponent and ContainerSlotComponent.**

## Entity categories | ElectroSR
- **they are good**
