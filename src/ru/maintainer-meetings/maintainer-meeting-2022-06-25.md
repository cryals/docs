## Making wide attack click-based was a mistake | Remie
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/980204271385604106)
- Too much friendly fire with Kudzu
    - **Kudzu needs to be fixed separately**
- Most weapons shouldn't have broad-angle wide attacks
    - **Spears should have spear-like attacks**
- Make it toggleable to let the user decide?
    - Need to pick a sane default
    - **Experiment with making it a hold attack, when you release left-mouse button**
    - Windup?
        - **Experiment with it too**


## Disbanding scheduled playtests for now | moony
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/986359940400680980)
- Letting in a select amount of users at a time
- High pop has design and game administration problems
- We set the cap to 65 recently (raised to 130 during playtests)
- Some SS13 servers have such high pop counts
- **We need high pop maps for this**
- **They are important to get players invested and check out new things**
- Turn them into proper feature tests?
    - No because features will be broken and it will look bad
- **Decision: Change playtests to be at the same time as progress reports**


## Tile damage kinds | moony
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/986384961718353951)
- RobustToolbox's tiles are too limited and don't have enough space
- Do we make a SS14-specific wrapper around tiles?
- Tile controllers?
    - **A separate system from normal ECS is not convenient**
- Make them use normal components and ECS?
    - **We need to make our ECS not shit and implement transformless entities**


## ECS refactor | Jezithyr
- Two-layer ECS, archetypical for perf and sparse for entity glut, similar to the concept of worlds in some ECS
- In archetypical ECS, the problem is that adding more components to an entity at runtime is slow
    - **We do this sometimes**
    - Iterating and filtering entities is very fast
- With worlds we can have replays with their own world and entities
    - Multithreading
- C# binds for FLECS exist
    - **Decision: Experiment with it**
- Rewrite our own ECS with the important parts in C# instead?
    - NIH my beloved
    - Less performance overhead with marshalling
    - More work to maintain
- Do we need to cut down on remo
- Flecs fixed my marriage
    - Me irl
    - Good for containers with child entities
- Is this the next engine rewrite
- Back to Godot
- Try to not cause an API breakage
- A - Vera


## Right-click for both entity menu and verb menu on entities is unintuitive | mirrorcult
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/988966819018707004)
- It's unintuitive because you have to right click twice
- There's no indication it's possible to open the verb menu
- How do we solve this
    - **Decision: Trigger on hover**
    - Properly handle moving diagonally onto submenu (don't make the submenu close instantly on hover leave)


## Expanding who can merge PRs | moony
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/988983179262189639)
- Junior maints / trusted reviewers?
- We need more people to get content PRs through
- Expanding triage perms?
- **Need more people to review**
- **Decision: Make review guidelines**
    - Add big/breaking code changes to the codebase changes channel


## Protect master branch | mirrorcult
- [Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/310555209753690112/900426319433728030/989048858216636446)
- We are getting 500 PRs a month anyway help
- We need it to make downstreams have an easier time merging changes
- Prevents cringe pushes to master
- Too many commands to update the submodule
    - **Solution: make a script, you can make PRs from the CLI too**
- **Decision: protect master branch**
