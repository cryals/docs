## Component shutdown events | ElectroSR
- Should we combine ComponentShutdown and ComponentRemove events?
    - Yes, but also remove the separation between component Add and Init (and Startup)
    - Also remove component enabling/disabling
- Should we add a new event that only gets raised when a component is explicitly removed, rather than due to entity deletion. Standard removal events would still get raised.
    - Context: removal logic that is a waste of time if the entity is just getting deleted anyways.
    - Components shouldn't do complex work in removal/deletion. Deletion should just get rid of things as aggressively as possible, only keeping the game state consistent.
    - Removal of components should be private to systems rather than a public API. Systems should do "on removal" logic themselves in a public function that removes components for you.
        - Make it opt in (Access attribute).
    - Keep a deletion event if the entity is deleted altogether, but don't fire it if individual component is removed.
        - Combined with the earlier point, this means that if you ABSOLUTELY MUST run code on all component removals, you need to explicitly call it from both your public removal function AND on deletione event.
    - Keep a component removal event in case some use case really needs it.
- If we have a separate explicit removal event, can we eventually remove InSafeOrder() & just enforce that component removal doesn't require querying other components on that entity?
    - **YES**

Edit with bonus questions:
- If the events are merged, what do we do with deffered component removal. Currently it raises a shutdown event, but defers the remove event & actual removal.
    - idk
- Also: should events be raised for components that are deferred for removal (i.e., should the subscription enumerator check the component's lifestage?)
    - idk 2


## UI stylesheets and themes | ElectroSR
- Meeting topic/discussion: Stylesheets & themes.
- How do we make them better? Stylesheets and rich text should probably use themes when possible.

- Decision:
    - Combine stylesheets and themes, move it to YAML
        - Context: stylesheets are originally C# because they need to be able to describe C# objects like style boxes, and `.css` can't do that.
        - Whoever makes the YAML syntax has to figure out how to implement constants for re-use in the stylesheet.
    - Make it easy to extend stylesheets (edits of simple properties, colors etc).
    - For complex animations/styling of controls, content should inherit engine controls and implement logic there.
        - We will not be implementing more complex styling functions from CSS like built-in transitions, aniamtions, descendant selector.
