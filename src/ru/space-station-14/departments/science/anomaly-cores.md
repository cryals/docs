The intention of this proposal is not to expand the anomaly gameplay system through breadth (i.e. more stuff) but to add new dimensions of gameplay and new incentives entirely. This will be done through two main additions: **inert & decaying anomaly cores**, and the **G.O.R.I.L.L.A Gauntlets**.

## Anomaly Cores

**Anomaly cores** are generated when an anomaly dissipates in some way. An *inert* core is spawned when an anomaly is fully contained and fizzles out, and a *decaying* core is spawned when an anomaly goes supercritical.

Inert cores are functionally useless on their own, sell for a small amount of money, and glow faintly. They become useful in conjunction with the G.O.R.I.L.L.A, which will be elaborated on later. They can also be made into anomaly core pie!

**Decaying cores** are the interesting ones. When an anomaly goes supercritical, it will spawn a decaying anomaly core of the same type as the anomaly. These cores can be sold for a large sum of money, converted into a fairly high amount of research points, or *used by anyone for a one-time anomaly-specific benefit* (this use will not be included in the initial PR for scope reasons).

Over time, decaying anomaly cores will slowly *lose their value* and eventually convert into an inert anomaly core. If it isn't sold, exchanged, or used fast, then the whole endeavor could prove pointless.

### Intended Gameplay

The point of decaying anomaly cores being generated is twofold: First, it provides a potential benefit for anomalies which accidentally go supercritical or are untended to. Second, it gives anomalists the interesting choice to **intentionally make an anomaly go supercritical** for huge rewards, if they feel that they're capable of handling the aftermath.

Decaying anomaly cores being time-limited is very important. This introduces more gameplay by forcing people to take some risks to extract as much value as possible. For instance, you might just run into a supercritted gravitational anomaly to take its core even if you risk harming yourself. It also forces the decision of *how* to use the anomaly core quickly, which can lead to some fun social scenarios.

## The G.O.R.I.L.L.A Gauntlets

The G.O.R.I.L.L.A Gauntlets are an item obtainable through Tier 2 experimental research (subject to change). It functions as a set of wieldable power fists that can deal strong brute damage. However, they're not very strong on their own. To take full effect, they need to be **with an anomaly core**.

When the gauntlets are loaded with either type of anomaly core, they gain the ability to force throw anything they hit backwards, until it hits a wall. **This includes anomalies, and thus the gauntlets function as a method of moving anomalies.** Inert cores only give you five charges to work with (subject to change), while decaying cores will work until they run out, and deal significantly more damage.

Anomalies which are hit with the gauntlets will take some minor stability damage. Anomalies in the process of going supercritical can also be hit with the gauntlets. Because of the nature of how the force throw works and the limited charges of an inert core, anomalists will have to first consider the most efficient path and set of pushes to get the anomaly in a more useful location.

### Intended Gameplay

The G.O.R.I.L.L.A gauntlets open up many more choices for anomalists. Before, if an anomaly spawned in a particularly unfavorable spot (such as medbay), science was heavily pressured to contain and decay it entirely rather than trying to exploit it, and for good reason. People have often asked for a way to move anomalies, but of course, anomalies' locations being random is a huge part of what makes them interesting to contain.

With the G.O.R.I.L.L.A gauntlets, anomalists have a way to move unwieldy anomalies in an interesting way that generates rather than removes gameplay:
- The gauntlets require an inert core and research, so science must already have invested some time into anomalies already
- The inert cores have finite charges, so science cannot always rely on them
- The movement of the anomaly is not as simple as 'point A to point B', and because of the limited charges, scientists must consider the location of the anomaly and where they'll be able to move it within 5 pushes, kind of like a box-pushing game or a Pokemon ice tile puzzle, which is a fun mini-challenge on its own. 
- Expert anomalists will be able to modify the environment to get anomalies in even more favorable locations and they will likely have to coordinate with others to move it through doors, hallways, into smaller rooms, etc, introducing a new degree skill expression, on top of knowing when to make the decision to try and move one rather than contain or harness it.
