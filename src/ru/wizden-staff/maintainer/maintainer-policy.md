# Maintainer Policy
This is the policy that all maintainers are expected to follow when it comes to behavior and responsibilities. 

This policy applies in addition to the [General Staff](../staff-policy.md) and [Conflict Resolution](../staff-conflict-resolution.md) Polices.

**Breaking any of these rules will result in disiplinary action being taken**
## Reviews and Feedback
- All maintainers must follow the [PR Review](../maintainer/review-procedure.md) and [Hotfix Procedures](../maintainer/hotfix-procedure.md) when they apply.
- Maintainers should try to the best of their ability, to keep PR authors informed on the status of their PRs.
- Maintainers should keep public criticism of code *constructive* and avoid making comments in regards to the authors of the code. **Harsh but fair** citicism of code is *acceptable*, but criticism of its author is not.
- Maintainers should try to perform code reviews *whenever possible*, getting content into the game is everyone's responsibility.
- If there is a conflict around game design between something in the docs and someone's idea, what is detailed in the documentation takes precedent. If a change to specific documentation is needed, it should be brought up with the respective work group for discussion and changes should be made to the documentation if needed.
