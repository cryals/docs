# Asset Packaging

## Asset Graphs

For parallel processing of game files during packaging, Robust has an "asset graph" system that provides a flexible way to process assets. 

The system is well-documented in doc comments on the relevant classes. Start by looking at `Robust.Packaging.AssetProcessing.AssetPass` and surrounding classes.
